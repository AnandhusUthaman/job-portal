### Project Description
Job Portal Website
Built a modern, scalable MERN stack job portal based on a tutorial from the GreatStack YouTube channel, enabling seamless job listings, applications, and comprehensive administrative management.


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used

For Software:
Languages Used: The core languages for a MERN stack application are JavaScript and its superset, TypeScript. JavaScript is used for both the front-end (React) and back-end (Node.js/Express.js), ensuring a seamless development experience.

Frameworks Used:

Node.js: A back-end JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run server-side code.

Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build APIs and handle routing.

React: A front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's component-based, which helps in creating reusable UI elements.

Libraries Used:

MongoDB: A NoSQL, document-based database used to store application data.

Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It simplifies the interaction with the database.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A standard for creating access tokens that assert claims. JWT is often used for user authentication and authorization.

bcrypt: A library to securely hash passwords before storing them in the database.

Tools Used:

npm: Package managers for JavaScript, used to install and manage project dependencies.

Postman: A tool for testing APIs.

VS Code: A popular code editor with extensive support for web development.

Git/GitHub: Version control system to track changes and collaborate on the project.
